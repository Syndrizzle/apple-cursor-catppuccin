Open source macOS Cursors for `Windows` and `Linux` with _HiDPI Support_ .

Check [url=https://github.com/ful1e5/apple_cursor]README.md[/url] for installation, uninstallation, personalize cursor sizes or colors.

[b]Notice:[/b]
Until 2021 my cursors projects were well funded by 'pling.com' but since the 'pling-factor' on the website has decreased and monthly payments are <500$, It is now dependent on community funding and sponsorships. If you want to help me to maintain macOS Cursors and my other open source projects actively, consider sponsoring my work on [url=https://github.com/sponsors/ful1e5]GitHub Sponsors[/url] or DM me on [url=https://twitter.com/ful1e5]Twitter[/url] if your company would like to support this project, I will gladly look into it and post your avatar in the README.

I appreciate all the wonderful people who patronize and sponsoring my work.
